# MedievalPirateIceSummer

The title for the game is New Pirate Wars

The intent and narrative structure for the game is for it to be a brawl like game that is set on a pirates ship. There would be the main player (you) and then there would be oppontents that are bots and they would engage with you the player until either they won the brawl or you did.

The player would use the arrow keys or the wasd keys to move the player and use the mouse as input on where the camera would be facing.

The aesthetic choice was to be a pirate themed game.

Assests:

Taryn- I worked on getting a navmesh on the ship for the characters to be able to walk on and not got all over the place. I also worked on getting the camera to follow the main player even though it still feels choppy and is not all that smooth. I found a source that helped me with the enemy script to get the enemy players to have a seek steering behavior in a 3D space.
